    <p>
      <strong>Elephantidae</strong> is a family of large, herbivorous
      proboscidean mammals collectively called elephants and mammoths. These are
      large terrestrial mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth
      modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct.
      Only two genera,

        <em>Loxodonta</em></a
      >
      <em>(African elephants)</em>
      and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephas" target="_blank">
        <em>Elephas</em>
      </a>
      <em>(Asian elephants)</em>, are living. The family was first described by
      John Edward Gray in 1821,[5] and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within
      the order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to
      include or exclude other extinct proboscidean genera.
